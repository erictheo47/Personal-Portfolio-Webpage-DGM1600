            <h1>About The Cards.</h1>
            <p>The <em>Star Wars</em> franchise is great in the way that every character each has their own unique traits and abilities, which makes collecting them as trading cards that much more worth it.</p>
            <p>Rey Skywalker &lpar;Palpatine&rpar; can heal using the force, Jedi who have passed on, such as Master Yoda or Obi-Wan Kenobi, can reach out to others using the force to offer guidance. Different species even have different affinities and tolerances to the elements.</p>
            <p>Below, you'll find a strong collection of trading cards based on the characters, creations and creatures from the first seven <em>Star Wars</em> films.</p>
            <p>Add your favorite characters to the list and build the ultimate collection!</p>
